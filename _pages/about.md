Hey there! 

I am a Ph.D. student at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute (RPI), under the supervision of [Mohammed J. Zaki](http://www.cs.rpi.edu/~zaki/). My research topic primarily focuses on studying [Modern Hopfield Networks](https://proceedings.neurips.cc/paper_files/paper/2016/file/eaae339c4d89fc102edd9dbdb6a28915-Paper.pdf) and exploring their practicality on solving modern Machine Learning problems (e.g., generative tasks on images and graph classification). Fortunately, I am not alone in this interest as I work in conjunction with two great mentors, [Dmitry Krotov](https://mitibmwatsonailab.mit.edu/people/dmitry-krotov/) and [Benjamin Hoover](https://bhoov.com), to study the topic.
